# TETRIS
In this project, one of the classic puzzle games, Tetris, has been recreated by using Java and Java Swing Library. The reason why Java and Java Swing Library are chosen is that I developed a [Peg Solitaire Game](https://github.com/ecagri/GTU-HOMEWORKS/tree/cagri/CSE%20241%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Homework%208)  with Java and Java Swing Library in 2021 and I wanted to refresh my memory about Java and Java Swing Library.

**The game is located in the _"Application"_ folder. You can download and test it. Additionally, you can access the source codes in the _"Source_Codes"_ folder.**

**You can find the gameplay video on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ecagric/videos).**
